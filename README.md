# intro-to-self-driving-cars-nd
Projects done as a part of Udacity's 'Intro to Self driving cars Nano degree' program
## Project 1
The project was to implement a 2D Histogram filter to localize a simulated robot world. The theorem of total probability and Bayes rule were implemented in the move and sense function respenctively.

The blue dots represent the predicted probability at the given location and the star represents actual location.
