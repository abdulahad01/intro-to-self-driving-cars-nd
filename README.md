# intro-to-self-driving-cars-nd
Projects done as a part of Udacity's 'Intro to Self driving cars Nano degree' program
## Project 1
The project was to implement a 2D Histogram filter to localize a simulated robot world. The theorem of total probability and Bayes rule were implemented in the move and sense function respenctively.

The blue dots represent the predicted probability at the given location and the star represents actual location.

## Project 2  
The project was to implement a matrix class which would be used to implement a 2D Kalman Filter on randomly generated Lidar data to track a car. The matrix class was successfully implemented to incorporate any n- dimensional matrix and Kalman filter was tested.

## Project 3
The project was to translate the python code for the 2d Histogram filter implemented in project1 into C++ . Learned about the OOP's concepts in C++, vectors, memory allocation and pointers in the process.
